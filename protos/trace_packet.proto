// TracePacket is the root object of a Perfetto trace.
// A Perfetto trace is a linear sequence of TracePacket(s).
//
// The tracing service guarantees that all TracePacket(s) written by a given
// TraceWriter are seen in-order, without gaps or duplicates. If, for any
// reason, a TraceWriter sequence becomes invalid, no more packets are returned
// to the Consumer (or written into the trace file).
// TracePacket(s) written by different TraceWriter(s), hence even different
// data sources, can be seen in arbitrary order.
// The consumer can re-establish a total order, if interested, using the packet
// timestamps, after having synchronized the different clocks onto a global
// clock.
//
// The tracing service is agnostic of the content of TracePacket, with the
// exception of few fields (e.g.. trusted_*, trace_config) that are written by
// the service itself.
//
// See the [Buffers and Dataflow](/docs/concepts/buffers.md) doc for details.

// Next id: 95.
